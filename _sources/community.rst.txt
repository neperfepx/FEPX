Keeping up-to-date
------------------

On `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX>`_, FEPX's official releases are available under the `release tab <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/releases>`_.  All official releases are tagged and available from the `main branch <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/tree/main>`_.
FEPX is under continuous development, and we push new commits to the `devel branch <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/tree/devel>`_ frequently.

Make sure to `watch <https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories#watching-a-single-repository>`_ `the GitHub repository <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX>`_ to be notified of new releases (or conversations, etc.).  If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one, which is a matter of minutes.

Getting Support
---------------

FEPX users should preferably report bugs directly to the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/issues>`_.  When reporting bugs, please help us helping you by providing a minimal working example (see general guidelines `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example>`_ or `here <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`_).

Contributing
------------

Contributions to FEPX are more than welcome and should be submitted as `pull requests on the GitHub repository <https://github.com/acmelab-ua/FEPX/pulls>`_.
